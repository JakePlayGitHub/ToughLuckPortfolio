               <h2>Growing up</h2>

                <p>Growing up I always wanted a computer, and once I finally got one I became addicted... After a while I got bored and playing games and decided I wanted to make my own. I started off in Scratch and gradully moved to Roblox Studio. I started to learn the language that Roblox uses which is a modifed version of Luau. After a while I got into Python, and started to learn that. Once I got good at Python I was interested in webdevelopment, and decided to start off in HTML, and CSS, moving to some Javascript. I now know multiple programming languages for example Python, Lua, HTML, CSS, Javascript, MySQL, GDScript, and some C++.</p>
